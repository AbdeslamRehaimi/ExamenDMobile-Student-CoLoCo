# Student Co_Location - Developement Mobile 2 (Flutter)

A Fine take on creating an application mobile named Student-Co_Location to help student find easly and share accommodation locations with others.

## About Project

The goal is to implement a mobile application that will manage the sharing of co-location notices between students at a university. The application will manage
offers and requests for co-rentals. The application will use a map (googlemap / leaflet) to display the positions of the co-location notices. The application
will use Firebase to manage its data. A co-location offer can be made by a user of the application by creating an account and completing a
form which will indicate the details of its offer:
- The address of the accommodation, the area, the price and the capacity (the number of students)
- WiFi, Lave-linge, â€¦, etc
- Pictures of the accommodation
